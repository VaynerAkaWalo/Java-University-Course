## Java University Course

This repository contains my solutions to various assignments completed during my university Java course. The assignments covered a wide range of topics, from testing knowledge of different collections, to multi-threaded calculations, and even implementing the Observer design pattern. There were also tasks to demonstrate proficiency in using JDBC for database connectivity, writing a custom archiver, creating a TCP client, and implementing Conway's Game of Life.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate modules, each containing a specific assignment solution. Inside each module, you will find detailed README files with the assignment descriptions.

## Testing

In some modules, I have written tests using JUnit 5 to verify the correctness of my solutions.


Feel free to explore each assignment, its source code, and README file to understand the solutions and how they meet the assignment requirements.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on any assignment or its implementation, please don't hesitate to reach out.
